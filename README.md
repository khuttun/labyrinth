# Labyrinth

Labyrinth is a virtual version of [the classic labyrinth marble game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(marble_game)) written in Rust.

## Build

First, compile the shaders by installing [glslangValidator](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/Reference-Compiler/), and running

```
glslangValidator -V -o src/default.frag.spv -e main src/default.frag
glslangValidator -V -o src/default.vert.spv -e main src/default.vert
glslangValidator -V -o src/shadow.vert.spv -e main src/shadow.vert
```

in the project main directory.

Then, [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), and do

```
cargo build --release
```

in the project main directory.

### Android

Labyrinth can be built for Android using [cargo-mobile](https://github.com/BrainiumLLC/cargo-mobile). The Labyrinth repo doesn't contain any of the files that can be generated by cargo-mobile, so they need to be generated before the build. The process is

1. Create an empty directory and init a cargo-mobile project with name "labyrinth" there using the wgpu template pack
2. Copy the directories ".cargo", "assets" and "gen", and the file "mobile.toml" to Labyrinth main directory
3. Follow the cargo-mobile instructions for building the project for Android (in the Labyrinth directory)

## Modules

### `game`

Implements the core game logic and physics. Takes no stance on how the game is presented or how user input is given. Note that even though Labyrinth is a 3D game, the physics in `game` module are 2D.

### `graphics`

Implements a scene graph based 3D graphics engine using the [wgpu-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-rs) library. Not specific to Labyrinth, could in principle be used for other purposes also.

Everything else (the main game loop, user input, creating textures, animation, helper functions...) is implemented in lib.rs.
