- Improve corner bounces
    - The problem seems to be that the collision response is only in axis direction
    - This gives wrong effect when the ball center has passed the wall
        - For example: ball_pos.x < wall.pos.x and ball collides to top of the wall
    - Idea: do the collision response to closest_point_in_wall.angle_to(ball_pos) direction
        - For side collisions this should have same result as current code
        - For corner collisions more realistic?
        - Could simplify code?
- Winning & losing
    - Restart current/start next level?
    - Texts?
- Draw the line from start to end
- Better graphics
- Fixed timestep physics?
